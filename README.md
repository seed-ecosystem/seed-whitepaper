> Private Messaging Platform

First Messaging Platform that does not identify you

Learn more about our fancy protocol: [here](protocol/README.md).

## Private by Design

We believe that you shouldn't trust server and developers. Protocol itself implies that
your messages are impossible to read.

## No Authorization

You can start using the app with a single click. No authorization needed.
Even for synchronization.

## Transparent

Our project is open-source and everyone can see the code. Server is also open-source,
though you can't really verify if the same code is running on our production.
Thanks to the protocol itself, even malicious server can't get any
data from your messages!

## No ADs. Ever

Everything is either local, or encrypted. Because server can't see contents of anything, we
can't do targeted ADs, therefore even if we would want to add ADs, we couldn't. Who will want to
buy ADs in our service if they can't be targeted?
